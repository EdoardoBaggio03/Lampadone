# Lampadone 💡 
 Lampadone is a PCB project of mine to control an RGB lamp (commone anode types) using three slider to manually regulate each color, 
 Lampadone also have a usb type A and type-C standard 5V output to charge any usb device with it
 please note that the slider footprint are custom and selfmade for an old slider that i have used, there are plenty of similar sliders online but i can't guarantee that they will fit perfectly with my footprint
 
 # ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ 
 note that this circuit is not suited for every kind of lamp, so be aware that it might burn your lamp or not work properly
 this circuit modulates the voltage of every channel, with a maximum of around 20/25V (depending on he supply voltage) per channel
 also note that the board might get hot if the usb device plugged drains lot of current
