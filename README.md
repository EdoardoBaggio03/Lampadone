# Lampadone 💡 
 Lampadone is a PCB project of mine to control an RGB lamp using three slider to manually regulate each color 
 
 # ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ 
 note that this circuit is not suited for every kind of lamp, so be aware that it might burn your lamp or not work properly
 this circuit modulates the voltage of every channel, with a maximum of around 20/25V (depending on he supply voltage) per channel
